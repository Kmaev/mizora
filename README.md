Mizora: Houdini VEX Code Manager

Mizora is a tool designed to streamline code and variable management within Houdini projects. In complex Houdini scenes, organizing and maintaining VEX code can become tedious and error-prone. Mizora addresses this by offering efficient tools to search, edit, and refactor VEX code at scale.

Key Features:

Context-Based Search: Search for variables across specific Houdini contexts (e.g., /obj/geo1, /obj/*) to quickly locate variable definitions and usages across the scene hierarchy.
Variable Renaming: Batch rename variables within selected nodes or across multiple nodes to maintain consistency and reduce human error.
VEX Code Editing: Integrated code editor with syntax highlighting for VEX, improving readability and speeding up the workflow for technical artists.
Mizora improves the maintainability of Houdini projects by reducing manual search and edit operations, helping avoid common naming mistakes and streamline VEX scripting practices.
