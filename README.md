I developed this tool to assist in managing variables and code within Houdini projects. 
It offers a range of features to work with VEX code efficiently and in an organized manner.

Context-Based Search: Allows searching for variables within a specified Houdini context, 
such as /obj/my_geometry or /obj*, helping to pinpoint variable occurrences across the scene.

Variable Renaming: Facilitates renaming variables within a selected node or across multiple nodes,
ensuring consistent variable naming throughout the project.

VEX Code Editing: Provides an integrated editor that supports VEX code editing, 
with syntax highlighting to enhance readability and ease of use.
