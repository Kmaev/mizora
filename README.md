# Mizora: Houdini VEX Code Manager

Mizora is a tool designed to simplify code and variable management workflows within Houdini projects.  
As scenes grow in complexity, organizing and maintaining VEX code can become tedious and error-prone.  
Mizora addresses these challenges by providing tools to efficiently search, edit, and refactor VEX code across large Houdini scenes.

## Key Features

### Context-Based Variable Search
Search for variables across specific Houdini contexts (e.g., `/obj/geo1`, `/obj/*`) to quickly locate definitions and usages throughout the scene hierarchy.

### Batch Variable Renaming
Rename variables across selected nodes or multiple nodes in bulk, promoting consistency and reducing human error.

### Integrated VEX Code Editor
Built-in editor with syntax highlighting for VEX scripting.  
Enhances readability and supports faster code refactoring directly within the Houdini environment.

### Maintainability Focused
Helps technical artists and TDs reduce manual search and edit operations, minimizing common naming mistakes and improving the maintainability of complex Houdini projects.
